                    Rapid changes in technology have created personal and employment choices that challenge each of us to find our place as contributing citizens in the emerging society. 
                    Life in the 21st century presents significant opportunities, but it also creates potential hazards and ethical problems that demand responsible solutions.
                    I was able to assess my strength and apply critical thinking and decision-making tools to help resolve some of the 
                    important issues in the society with its competing interests.

                <p class="work1">
                    This involves the study of algebraic and transcendental functions, an essential prerequisite to Calculus. I worked around algebraic expressions, solved algebraic equations and 
                    linear systems and learnt the properties of and graphed algebraic and transcendental functions. In addition, I also studied computer number systems in addition to Boolean algebra 
                    and logic to help solve problems involving computer systems. Finally I studied the addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components.

                    Maintaining a computer, using operating system and productivity software, and expressing related environmental and sustainability concerns, is an important part 
                    of working with Information Technology. I learnt about computer hardware, and used operating system software to maintain, utilize, and secure a computer. 
                    I practised the use of spreadsheet software to solve problems, use formulas, and visualize data with charts. I learnt about computer hardware and software 
                    with regards to financial and environmental sustainability.

                <p class="work1">
                    Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many information technology systems. 
                    I learnt the fundamentals of relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, 
                    modify and query a database. I designed and created databases that are maintainable, secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using normalization. 
                    I became familiar with the functions of a Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.

                <p class="work1">Possessing the fundamentals of logic, problem-solving and programming language structure provides a solid foundation for further study in the field. 
                        I was introduced to computer programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, 
                        flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing, with the Java programming language used as a means to implement problem solution designs. 
                        Through an introduction to the Java programming language I used sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, 
                        variables, constants, methods, constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, 
                        inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation.

                <p class="work1">
                    Communication remains an essential skill sought by employers, regardless of discipline or field of study. Using a practical, vocation-oriented approach, 
                    I focused on meeting the requirements of effective communication. I practised writing, 
                    speaking, reading, listening, locating and documenting information and using technology to communicate professionally. I developed and strengthened communication skills 
                    that contribute to success in both educational and workplace environments.

                <p class="work1">
                    Operating systems form the backbone of information technology systems coordinating the interaction between hardware and software. 
                    I explored the basic concepts and components of Operating Systems (OS), and how they function and interact with hardware and software components. 
                    I examined the details of operating system structures, process management, storage management, installation, configuration, and administration both in theory and through practical assignments based on the GNU/Linux operating system.
